# Hire-N-Seek Backend (Spring Boot) 💼

This repository contains the backend implementation of the Hire-N-Seek application, which has been modified to use Spring Boot. Just so you know, this repository exclusively contains the backend logic, and the frontend is not included.

## Overview 🌐

Hire-N-Seek is a job posting and recruitment platform. This application version serves as the backend API, handling job postings, user authentication, and related functionalities.

### Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Spring Boot:** A powerful and convention-over-configuration based framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Java:** The programming language used for the backend logic.
- **RESTful API:** The backend exposes a RESTful API for communication with the front end.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run the backend locally or deploy it to a server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jxsrma/hirenseeksSpringBoot.git
   ```

2. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd hire-n-seek-backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

## Important Note ⚠️

This backend repository is intended to work with the front end of the original Django-based Hire-N-Seek application. Although it has been added but if you are looking for the complete application, including the front end, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/mananjain31/hire-n-seeks).
